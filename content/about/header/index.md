  Hi, my name is Jen Richmond.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a developmental psychologist by training and have been teaching myself (and others) R for a few years now. I am a co-founder of R-Ladies Sydney and developer of #RYouWithMe. This is my place to keep the R things I can't remember how to do. This site makes my R googling faster! I hope it is useful to you too. `r emo::ji("smile")`
