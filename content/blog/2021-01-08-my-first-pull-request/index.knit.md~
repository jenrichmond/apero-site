There are so many lovely packages for colour palettes (see links at the bottom of [this post](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/idhtg-how-to-use-colour-palettes-with-ggplot/) for more). 

This new one called `feather` by [Shandiya Balasubramanium](https://shandiyabalasubramaniam.weebly.com/) is inspired by Australian birds and is delightful. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I built my first R package! Meet feather: a set of colour palettes inspired by the plumage of Australian birds.

The vignette doesn't have any pictures of the birds though, so I thought it might be a good opportunity to help [Shandiya](https://twitter.com/ShandiyaB) out and try my first pull request. I am documenting the process here, so I can refer back to it for next time. 

# Trying out the feather package

I've installed the feather package from github... 


```r
devtools::install_github("shandiya/feather")
```

... and loaded the palette names

```r
library(feather)
```


You can print each palette by using the `get_pal()` function and the `print_pal()` function. There is the palette for the Eastern Rosella
