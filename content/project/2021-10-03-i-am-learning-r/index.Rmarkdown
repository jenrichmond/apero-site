Students often ask me what the best resources for learning R are... [#RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/) is a great start... 


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("learning.png")
```

...but I have another Distill site that showcases some of my other favourites at [iamlearningr.netlify.app](https://iamlearningr.netlify.app/)
