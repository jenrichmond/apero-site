One of my goals while on long service leave is to learn some new R things that have been on my radar for a while... the first of these is purrr. The purrr package allows you to iterate a function across different elements in a list or dataframe. 

I have started to try and learn purr before ([see google post here](https://jennyrichmond.netlify.app/blog/i-don-t-like-cats-much/) and  I have copied other people's purrr code a couple of times and used [map to read in a LOT of .csv files](https://jennyrichmond.netlify.app/blog/use-map-to-read-many-csv-files/) and pwalk to output plots in different colour schemes, but when you copy purrr code from someone else and adjust it to suit you own problem... you can't really say you know how to use purrr.
