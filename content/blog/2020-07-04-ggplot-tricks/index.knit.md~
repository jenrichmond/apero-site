Here are some ggplot tricks that I shared at the R-Ladies Sydney June Show and Tell. 

# Why is my internet speed so terrible?

Working from home and pivoting to teaching online has made me realise that my wifi connection is really bad, particularly when it rains. I have been teaching new honours students R and needed a little dataset to demo how to get data into R, so made a google form and put it out on twitter to confirm to myself that my connection really is worse than most other people. You can contribute to the [data here](www.tinyurl.com/howcrappyisyourinternet). 


# Packages for reading data into R


```r
library(tidyverse) # includes readr for .csv files
library(readxl) #for excel files
library(googlesheets4) #read straight from google sheets
library(datapasta) # for pasting data into R
library(janitor) # quick name cleaning
```


#### 1. read csv or xlsx

The standard way to get data into R is to read a file that you have downloaded. 

Read a .csv file


```r
speed1 <- read_csv("crappy_internet.csv")
```

Read an excel file

```r
 speed2 <- read_excel("crappy_internet.xlsx")
```


#### 2. direct from google docs

But the `googlesheets4` package allows you to authenticate your google account and read data straight from from googlesheets using only the url. More info here https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/
