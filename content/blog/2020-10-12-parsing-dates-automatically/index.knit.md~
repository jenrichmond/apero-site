I've been looking at old Tidy Tuesday datasets this week to try and work out why sometimes date data is automatically parsed as dates, like in the palmer penguin dataset...


```r
# read data from Tidy Tuesday
penguins_raw <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/penguins_raw.csv') %>%
  clean_names

# check class
class(penguins_raw$date_egg)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```

```r
# pull first date observation
penguins_raw$date_egg[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "2007-11-11"
```

And other times R thinks dates are characters, like in the marbles data. 


```r
# read data from Tidy Tuesday
marbles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-06-02/marbles.csv')

# check class
class(marbles$date)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
# pull first date observation
marbles$date[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "15-Feb-20"
```


I have already learned [how to use dmy()](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/converting-characters-to-dates/) and could convert the marble dates into date format pretty easily but...


```r
# convert date to dmy
marbles$date <- dmy(marbles$date)
# check class again
class(marbles$date)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```

... why doesn't R recognise them as dates automatically?

In the marbles data, the raw dates are in day-month-year format (i.e. 15-Feb-20). I like this format (because I live in Australia and it is consistent with how we write dates here), but maybe R prefers [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#:~:text=Although%20the%20standard%20allows%20both,YYYY%2DMM%20format%20is%20allowed1
) format (i.e. YYYY-MM-DD) and will only parse dates in that format? 

To test this hypothesis, I made a google form that asked respondents to enter their birthday 3 times...

- first, however they wanted
- second, using a date template
- third, in yyyy-mm-dd format
